						<h4><a class="anchor-link" id="motif-build-your-own-terms-of-use">Motif Build Your Own Terms of Use</a></h4>
						<p>These Build Your Own Terms of Use (“Terms of Use”) govern your use of the “Build Your Own” motif service (the “Service”) available through the Motif Investing, Inc.’s (“Motif Investing”) website (referred to as the “website”), including your use of the Service to create one or more motifs and publish them on the website. You acknowledge receipt of these Terms of Use and agree to check regularly for any amendments to the Terms of Use and other terms of use, customer or other agreements, and statements, which can be easily retrieved in one location within the <Support> tab.</p>
						<p>Motif Investing reserves the right to review and monitor the contents of any Build Your Own motif and block or remove content that it deems inappropriate in its sole discretion. Any such review in no way constitutes a determination that such motif is a sound or advisable investment or substitutes for an individual’s evaluation of whether an investment strategy or security is suitable for such individual.</p>
						<p>By accessing the website and creating a Build Your Own motif, you (a) grant to Motif Investing a perpetual, royalty-free, worldwide, non-exclusive, irrevocable, transferable license to copy, use, modify and publish your Build Your Own motif(s) (the “Licensed Motifs”) and all associated content, in each case as the same may be rebalanced or otherwise modified from time to time, on the website for use by persons accessing the website and to use any such information for its own internal use or in connection with processing trades or related activity, (b) represent and warrant to Motif Investing that you are the sole owner of the Licensed Motifs and all associated content and have the right to license the same to Motif Investing as described in (a), and (c) agree that Motif Investing may terminate this license in whole or in part at any time.</p>
						<p>You agree to adhere to the requirements embedded in the Service or set forth in these Terms of Use for the development of any motif that you create. Your motif may contain up to 30 individual exchange-listed securities. You may not include in your motif shares of mutual funds, corporate or government bonds, options, or over-the-counter stocks. You must provide a name and description of your Build Your Own motif and may also include a photo to be associated with the motif.</p>
						<p>Your creation and publishing of a Build Your Own motif and any content created by you and associated with a Build Your Own motif, including communications by you in the Motif Social Network, must adhere to the following code of conduct (in addition to the Motif Social Network Terms of Use):</p>
						<ul>
							<li>You will not create or build a motif targeted at a specific individual or class of individual investors. Any motif published pursuant to the Service will be designed for general investor interest and information.</li>
							<li>You will comply with the terms and spirit of the Terms of Use and all other terms of use relating to the website.
								Federal and state securities laws impose licensing and other requirements on investment advisers and brokers. You are solely responsible for complying with those requirements, to the extent that they apply to you. The Service and Motif Investing’s Creator Royalty Program are designed with the intent that if you comply with all of the Terms of Use you should not be required to register as an investment adviser under applicable law. However, the laws differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and there can be no assurances that this result will be achieved. Motif Investing is not providing any legal advice to you with respect to your activities. You should consult with your legal advisor as to whether your activities on the website or your use of the Service will cause you to be an investment adviser or subject you to licensing or registration requirements under the laws that apply to you.
							</li>
							<li>You will not engage in fraudulent or manipulative practices, including, but not limited to, making false or misleading statements to manipulate the price of any security. You will not trade on the basis of material non-public information or engage in schemes to front-run or pump-and-dump, or engage in any other fraudulent scheme or practice.</li>
							<li>You will not seek to profit from the Service other than through the payment of royalties that Motif Investing has agreed to pay you as a publisher of a Build Your Own motif. You will not accept compensation from any person in exchange for including a security of a particular issuer in a motif.
							</li>
							<li>You will limit references to investment performance to information specifically agreed upon by Motif Investing from time to time, and you will not make or publish claims about the expected performance of any motif, security or strategy. You will not make any guarantee or similar forward looking statement regarding changes in the values of securities or the performance of a particular motif or strategy. Without limiting the foregoing, you will not characterize a motif or any security as “sure to go up” or “sure to outperform” or make a substantially similar statement or characterization.
							</li>
							<li>In any of your communications on, through or facilitated by the website, you will not:
								<ul>
									<li>Refer to yourself as an investment counsel, investment adviser, investment manager, financial planner or any similar term that would imply that you have been engaged by Motif Investing or any user as a representative, employee, sub-advisor, or joint venture partner or by any user as a professional adviser;</li>
									<li>Provide personalized investment advice or recommendations to any person or group of persons. This includes the following:
										<ul>
											<li>linking any of your motifs to any other motif(s) or securities in a manner that suggests that they constitute an investment program;</li>
											<li>asking or answering questions relating to a specific individual’s financial or investment situation, objectives or holdings. In this regard, if you are currently receiving or expect to receive any royalty payments or other compensation from Motif Investing under its Creator Royalty Program, you agree to limit any discussion in which you engage to the analysis relating to your motif(s) and not how any such motif is expected to perform or otherwise might fit into an individual investment program; or</li>
