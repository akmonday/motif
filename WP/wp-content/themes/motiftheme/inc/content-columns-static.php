					<p class="body-text">Five years ago, I wanted to invest in the “mobile internet.” My friends told me to buy Apple (AAPL), but I wanted broader exposure to the “mobile ecosystem,” including chip manufacturers, cell phone towers and operators. At the time, no funds or ETFs adequately covered this investing concept.</p>
					<p class="body-text">So, we created a concept-driven trading platform that allows you to act on your investing desires—whether it’s a hot trend like “robotics revolution,” a trading strategy like “buy the dip,” or an investment style like “Ivy League endowment.” We make it easy to act on these concepts by turning them into motifs—intelligently weighted baskets of up to 30 stocks or exchange-traded funds. And you can do it all for just $9.95 per motif.</p>
					<p class="body-text">We also believe that every investor is unique. No two are the same with respect to their financial goals, time horizons, risk profiles, investing interests and personal values. Therefore our tools allow you to easily customize your portfolios by adding or deleting stocks or changing their weightings. Although we offer more than 150 professionally built portfolios, if you’re not interested in ours, you can easily build your own from scratch.</p>
					<p class="body-text-2">No matter if you’re an experienced investor looking for a simple, cost-effective platform to build portfolios or a newbie looking for an investment that reflects your interests and passions, Motif Investing provides you with a platform and tools to achieve your unique investing goals.</p>
